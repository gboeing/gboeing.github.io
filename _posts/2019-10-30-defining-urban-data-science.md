I'm a co-author on a [new
article]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/roundtable-urban-data-science/)
out in  _Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science_ titled
"A Roundtable Discussion: Defining Urban Data Science" (download [free
PDF]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/roundtable-urban-data-science/)). It
arises from a panel discussion I participated in at the 2019 AAG Annual
Meeting in DC. Vanessa Frias-Martinez, Song Gao, Ate Poorthuis, and Wenfei Xu
joined me on the panel, which was organized and moderated by Wei Kang, Taylor
Oshan, and Levi Wolf. From the abstract:

> The field of urban analytics and city science has seen significant growth
> and development in the past 20 years. The rise of data science, both in
> industry and academia, has put new pressures on urban research, but has also
> allowed for new analytical possibilities. Because of the rapid growth and
> change in the field, terminology in urban analytics can be vague and
> unclear. This paper, an abridged synthesis of a panel discussion among
> scholars in Urban Data Science held at the 2019 American Association of
> Geographers Conference in Washington, D.C., outlines one discussion seeking
> a better sense of the conceptual, terminological, social, and ethical
> challenges faced by researchers in this emergent field. The panel outlines
> the difficulties of defining what is or is not urban data science, finding
> that good urban data science must have an expansive role in a successful
> discipline of "city science." It suggests that "data science" has value as a
> "signaling" term in industrial or popular science applications, but which
> may not necessarily be well-understood within purely academic circles. The
> panel also discusses the normative value of doing urban data science,
> linking successful practice back to urban life. Overall, this panel report
> contributes to the wider discussion around urban analytics and city science
> and about the role of data science in this domain.
