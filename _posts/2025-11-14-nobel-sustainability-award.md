The Nobel Sustainability Trust has announced that our team has won the 2025
Nobel Sustainability Award for research for our [Global Observatory of Healthy
and Sustainable Cities][1].

I'm really proud of this group. I've had the pleasure of serving on our
executive committee and as the spatial team co-lead since its inception. We're a
member organization of the UN's Global Urban Observatory Network and we
published a [series of articles][2] in The Lancet Global Health a couple years
ago about our work to date.

Sincere thanks to the hundreds of researchers and practitioners in hundreds of
cities around the world who have joined our collaboration network over the past
few years. And thank you to my colleagues on the executive committee: it is
truly a pleasure working with you.
