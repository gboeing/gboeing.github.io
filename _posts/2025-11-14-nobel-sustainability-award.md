The Nobel Sustainability Trust has announced that our team has won the 2025
[Nobel Sustainability Award][2] for "outstanding research and development for
intelligent and sustainable urban solutions" for our [Global Observatory of
Healthy and Sustainable Cities][1] (GOHSC).

Urban sustainability is key to planetary health. Yet few cities have measurable
policy standards and targets to actually build healthier and more sustainable
cities, and their health-supportive built environment features are often
inadequate or inequitably distributed. Can residents sustainably access their
daily living needs? A critical step toward making cities healthier and more
sustainable is to empower policymakers and urban planners to consistently
measure neighborhood-level spatial indicators of the built environment.

At GOHSC, we measure spatial and policy indicators of healthy and sustainable
urban planning practice in partnership with a network of local collaborators in
cities around the world. Our analytics let non-technical users load and
transform their own local data to automatically calculate a set of indicators
and generate a report and scorecard infographic for advocacy work. Over the past
year, local planners, mayors' offices, citizen advocates, and international
organizations have used this software to measure, benchmark, and monitor cities'
progress toward global health and sustainability goals. This supports
evidence-informed interventions anywhere from the neighborhood scale to the
metropolitan scale. Our software's accessibility and rigor unlock the ability to
effect urgently needed change while reducing longstanding barriers to
participation, particularly in under-resourced cities and countries where better
planning for health and sustainability are most needed.

I'm really proud of this group. I've had the pleasure of serving on our
executive committee and as the spatial team co-lead since its inception. We're
a member organization of the UN's Global Urban Observatory Network and we
published a series of articles in [_The Lancet Global Health_][3] a couple years
ago about our work to date.

Sincere thanks to the hundreds of researchers and practitioners in hundreds of
cities around the world who have joined our collaboration network over the past
few years. And thank you to my colleagues on the executive committee: it is
truly a pleasure working with you.
