I'm happy to announce that I have accepted a tenure-track offer from the
University of Southern California as an assistant professor in the Sol Price
School's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis. I will be starting
in the Fall and moving to Los Angeles later this summer! Looking forward to
heading back home to California.
