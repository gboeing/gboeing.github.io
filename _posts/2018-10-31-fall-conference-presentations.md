I've been traveling a lot over the past month, presenting my recent research
at the Architect of the Future conference in Moscow, the Venice Biennale of
Architecture, and the ACSP conference in Buffalo. At the first two, I shared
my recent findings on how planners have used street networks to organize urban
space according to an evolving set of spatial logics during the 20th century.
At the third, I shared my findings on how technology platforms like Craigslist
can shape rental housing markets and also shape how researchers and
policymakers understand affordability. Both papers coming soon.

Looking ahead to the spring, in April I'll be presenting at UAA in Los Angeles
as well as a full slate at AAG in Washington, where I'll give a paper talk,
speak on an urban data science panel, and deliver the _Transactions in GIS_
plenary address. See you there!
