This is just a brief personal announcement that USC has decided to grant me
tenure and promote me to Associate Professor. This has been a long and arduous
journey, but I wouldn't have it any other way. There hasn't been much to
celebrate this year in academia or science or international collaboration—the
worlds in which I live my daily life—but here's a small thing to celebrate.

Thank you to everyone who supported me along the way.
