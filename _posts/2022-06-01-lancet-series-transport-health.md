After many years of hard work, our [series of articles][8] on urban design,
transport, and health has been published by _The Lancet Global Health_.

cities][12]

In our [first paper][3], we analyzed urban policies and calculated built
environment indicators for 25 cities across 6 continents to assess walkability
and accessibility. Our policy analysis found policies inconsistent with public
health evidence, rhetoric endorsing health and sustainability but few measurable
policy targets, and substantial implementation gaps.

measurable, evidence-based policies in place to support healthy sustainable
cities][14]

In our [second paper][2], our team calculated thresholds of built environment
characteristics that support two physical activity goals: 1) an 80% probability
of walking for transport, and 2) a 15% reduction in insufficient physical
activity through walking.

environment features that support UN SDG and WHO physical activity goals through
walking for transport][11]

I led our [third paper][4], in which our geospatial team developed open-source
software to calculate indicators of walkability and accessibility around the
world, and then linked these back to cities' policy contexts and identified
populations living above and below the thresholds for physical activity. Also
check out our appendix which contains 380 maps and visualizations for the 25
cities.

daily living needs in 25 global cities][13]

Our [fourth paper][1] sums up our findings and considers where we go from here.
Few cities in our study had measurable policy standards and targets to actually
build healthier and more sustainable cities, and their health-supportive built
environment features were often inadequate or inequitably distributed. The
[series][8] is also accompanied by a set of commentaries, from authors from
organizations like the [WHO][9] and [C40][5], reflecting on this research and
its implications for practice around the world.

We have simultaneously launched the [Global Observatory of Healthy and
Sustainable Cities][7] to advance healthy and sustainable urban planning,
benchmark and monitor cities' progress, and share more consistent, comparable
urban data. The whole [series of articles][8] is free and open access, as is
[our software][6]. Scorecards for our cities [are here][7] alongside the 1,000
Cities Challenge to which anyone can contribute. Here's an example scorecard for
São Paulo:
