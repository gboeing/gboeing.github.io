After many years of hard work, our
[series of articles](https://www.thelancet.com/series/urban-design-2022) on
urban design, transport, and health has been published by _The Lancet Global
Health_.

In our [first paper](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00069-9>), we
analyzed urban policies and calculated built environment indicators for 25
cities across 6 continents to assess walkability and accessibility. Our policy
analysis found policies inconsistent with public health evidence, rhetoric
endorsing health and sustainability but few measurable policy targets, and
substantial implementation gaps.

In our [second paper](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00068-7>), our team
calculated thresholds of built environment characteristics that support two
physical activity goals: 1) an 80% probability of walking for transport, and 2)
a 15% reduction in insufficient physical activity through walking.

I led our [third paper](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00072-9>), in
which our geospatial team developed open-source software to calculate indicators
of walkability and accessibility around the world, and then linked these back to
cities' policy contexts and identified populations living above and below the
thresholds for physical activity. Also check out our appendix which contains 380
maps and visualizations for the 25 cities.

Our [fourth paper](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00066-3>) sums up our
findings and considers where we go from here. Few cities in our study had
measurable policy standards and targets to actually build healthier and more
sustainable cities, and their health-supportive built environment features were
often inadequate or inequitably distributed. The
[series](https://www.thelancet.com/series/urban-design-2022) is also accompanied
by a set of commentaries, from authors from organizations like the
[WHO](https://www.who.int/) and
[C40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C40_Cities_Climate_Leadership_Group),
reflecting on this research and its implications for practice around the world.

We have simultaneously launched the
[Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/)
to advance healthy and sustainable urban planning, benchmark and monitor cities'
progress, and share more consistent, comparable urban data. The whole
[series of articles](https://www.thelancet.com/series/urban-design-2022) is free
and open access, as is
[our software](https://github.com/global-healthy-liveable-cities). Scorecards
for our cities [are here](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/) alongside
the 1,000 Cities Challenge to which anyone can contribute. Here's an example
scorecard for São Paulo:
