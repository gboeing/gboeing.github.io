My article "[Housing Search in the Age of Big Data: Smarter Cities or the Same
Old Blind Spots?]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/publications/housing-search-big- data/)" with Max Besbris, Ariela Schachter,
and John Kuk is now published in _Housing Policy Debate_. We look at the
quantity and quality of information in online housing listings and find that
they are much higher in White and non- poor neighborhoods than they are in poor,
Black, or Latino neighborhoods. Listings in White neighborhoods include more
descriptive text and focus on unit and neighborhood amenities, while listings in
Black neighborhoods focus more on applicant (dis)qualifications. We discuss what
this means for housing markets, filter bubbles, residential sorting and
segregation, and housing policy. You can download a [free PDF]({{ site.url

Housing search technologies are changing and, as a result, so are housing search
behaviors. The most recent American Housing Survey revealed that, for the first
time, more urban renters found their current homes through online technology
platforms than any other information channel. These technology platforms collect
and disseminate user-generated content and construct a virtual agora for users
to share information with one another. Because they can provide real-time data
about various urban phenomena, housing technology platforms are a key component
of the smart cities paradigm.

This paradigm promotes information technology as both a technocratic mode of
monitoring cities and a utopian mode of improving urban life through big data.
In this context, "big data" typically refers to massive streams of user-
generated content resulting from millions or billions of decentralized human
actions. Data exhaust [from Craigslist]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/2016/08/craigslist-rental-housing- insights/) and other housing technology
platforms offers a good example: optimistically, large corpora of rental
listings could provide housing researchers and practitioners with actionable
[insights for policymaking]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/publications/rental-housing-spot- markets/) while also equalizing [access to
information]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/publications/online-housing-market-urban- inequality/) for otherwise
disadvantaged homeseekers. But how good are these platforms at resolving the
types of problems that already plague old- fashioned, non-big data? Does this
broadcasting of information reduce longstanding geographic and demographic
inequalities or do established patterns of segmentation and sorting remain?

On one hand, as a publicly available and free technology platform, Craigslist
offers exceptionally low barriers to entry. Unlike newspaper listings or
brokers, it requires no payment from landlords to list their own units. With
such low barriers to entry, Craigslist could possibly be the most representative
exchange of rental information, although use is contingent on access and ability
to navigate the internet. While alternative information channels exist for
luxury rental listings, low-income listings, and non- English listings,
Craigslist is by far the most trafficked and largest single source of rental
information. In this paper we review, empirically extend, and retheorize ongoing
research projects that collected Craigslist rental listings via web scraping.

We find significant sociospatial differences in both the volume and type of
information provided to prospective tenants on Craigslist. Recent work has
speculated about the potential of technology platforms to democratize
information and broaden homeseeker choice sets, but our findings question these
platforms' ability to make searches more equitable: online rental listings
reproduce historical patterns of residential steering, sorting, and (information
channel) segregation as a function of existing demographics and inequality.
Given the segregated nature of the housing search process, our findings
demonstrate that online housing listings are more likely to exacerbate rather
than ameliorate inequality.

Listings in poor White, Black, and Latino tracts, as well as non-poor Black and
Latino tracts, contain fewer words on average than listings in non-poor White
tracts. Listings in poor Black tracts contain fewer average words than any other
tract type, and even non-poor Black tracts contain fewer than all other tract
types except poor Black and poor Latino tracts. In contrast, listings in poor
and non-poor Asian tracts contain more words on average than those posted in all
other tracts, including non-poor White tracts. Per-listing information volume
varies at the intersection of race and poverty, leaving poor Latino and,
particularly, Black tracts the most relatively disadvantaged in terms of
information content.

Further, the information in listings in tracts with more Black, Latino, or
poorer residents disproportionately focuses on tenant (dis)qualifications (e.g.,
proof of income, eviction history, criminal history) rather than unit/amenity
descriptions. In contrast, listings in whiter or lower-poverty areas contain
more information and devote more text to describing units/amenities. A clear
relationship exists between tract poverty and the amount and type of information
provided, but there is also a racial hierarchy: listings in low-poverty Black or
Latino communities contain less information and a stronger focus on tenant
(dis)qualifications compared to low-poverty White communities. Listings in White
tracts have a more extensive discussion of neighborhood amenities (e.g.,
proximity to parks and restaurants, public transportation, etc.) than Black or
Latino tracts.

We focused on Craigslist here because compared to other housing technology
platforms it is the largest and most democratic in that it has minimal barriers
to entry and no listing costs. Yet despite being the most accessible
platform—and despite having no complicated algorithms that target search
results—we still find that user-generated information reproduces traditional
information segregation patterns. Other online housing platforms potentially
distribute information in even more unequal ways, constructing filter bubbles in
the residential search and sorting process. In fact, HUD recently sued Facebook
for violating fair housing laws, claiming their platform limits who can see
advertisements for housing based on their race/ethnicity, religion, and current
location. As cities and citizens increasingly turn to technology platforms to
mediate urban processes, more unanticipated consequences, such as these housing
information filter bubbles, will likely appear.

New urban technology platforms and their data both reflect our world and shape
it. Despite the optimistic rhetoric of smart cities advocates, techno-utopian
solutions are rarely equalizing in practice or even in design. Cities
increasingly rely on technology platforms as a mode of governance,
administration, observation, and participation—but, in many ways, this reliance
can reproduce or even exacerbate preexisting inequalities. While these platforms
reflect millions of disaggregate transactions among rental market participants,
they also reconstruct the market itself. Online listings can reduce housing
search costs, expand search radii without requiring physical location visits,
and broaden homeseeker choice sets. But housing information quantity and quality
vary between neighborhoods, correlated with sociodemographics.

In turn, the information-broadcasting benefits of these housing technology
platforms are unevenly distributed among communities. On one hand, this
unevenness concentrates the technology's benefits in privileged communities. On
the other hand, it could also open up such communities to information- deprived
housing seekers by making whiter, wealthier, and better-educated communities
more-equally legible to everyone in the search process through a larger volume
of rental listings and higher-quality unit information.

Overall, the differences documented here measure how online platforms with user
generated content do not automatically smooth information exchange, reduce
information asymmetries, or attenuate entrenched sociospatial inequalities. This
is not simply a data problem. Although Craigslist's biases may be unintended,
they nevertheless point to the broader limits of housing technology platforms
themselves—which rely on user self-selection and structural market forces to
generate information.
