OSMnx v2.0.0 is targeted for release later in 2024. This major release includes
some breaking changes (including removing previously deprecated functionality)
that are not backwards compatible with v1. See the [migration guide][1] and
[reference paper][2] for details.

The first beta pre-release is out now, and testers are needed. If you use OSMnx,
you can help test it by installing the latest pre-release. Create a virtual
environment then run: `pip install --pre osmnx`

For more, check out the [migration guide][1] and [reference paper][2].
