OSMnx v2.0.0 is targeted for release later in 2024. This major release
includes some breaking changes (including removing previously deprecated
functionality) that are not backwards compatible with v1. See the [migration
guide](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx/issues/1123) and [reference
paper]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/osmnx-paper/) for details.

The first beta pre-release is out now, and testers are needed. If you use
OSMnx, you can help test it by installing the latest pre-release. Create a
virtual environment then run: `pip install --pre osmnx`
