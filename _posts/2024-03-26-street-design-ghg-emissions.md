I have a new [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2023.103961) out in
_Transportation Research Part D_ that estimates relationships between street
network characteristics and transport CO2 emissions across every urban area in
the world and investigates whether they are the same across development levels
and design paradigms.

The relationships between street network design and transport emissions in the
US, Europe, and China are well-studied. But not so in many of the most rapidly
developing parts of the world. Practitioners lack a strong local evidence base
for local evidence-informed planning.

We find that, all else equal, more-connected and straighter streets are
associated with lower emissions, while greater street lengths per capita are
associated with more emissions. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in
these relationships.

In other words, these relationships vary across development levels and urban
design paradigms—yet most prior literature reports findings from urban areas
that are outliers by global standards.

Evidence derived from global models or dissimilar world regions will yield
conclusions inapplicable to most local planning contexts. Planners need a better
empirical base for evidence-informed practice in under-studied regions,
particularly the rapidly urbanizing Global South.
