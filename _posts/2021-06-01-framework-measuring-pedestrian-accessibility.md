I'm a co-author of a new article, "[A Generalized Framework for Measuring
Pedestrian Accessibility around the World Using Open Data][1]," which has just
been published by _Geographical Analysis_. We developed an open source,
containerized software framework for modeling pedestrian networks using open
data to analyze disaggregate access to daily living needs. We worked with local
partners in 25 cities around the world to demonstrate and validate this toolkit.

From the abstract:

> Pedestrian accessibility is an important factor in urban transport and land
> use policy and critical for creating healthy, sustainable cities. Developing
> and evaluating indicators measuring inequalities in pedestrian accessibility
> can help planners and policymakers benchmark and monitor the progress of city
> planning interventions. However, measuring and assessing indicators of urban
> design and transport features at high resolution worldwide to enable city
> comparisons is challenging due to limited availability of official, high
> quality, and comparable spatial data, as well as spatial analysis tools
> offering customizable frameworks for indicator construction and analysis. To
> address these challenges, this study develops an open source software
> framework to construct pedestrian accessibility indicators for cities using
> open and consistent data. It presents a generalized method to consistently
> measure pedestrian accessibility at high resolution and spatially aggregated
> scale, to allow for both within- and between-city analyses. The open source
> and open data methods developed in this study can be extended to other cities
> worldwide to support local planning and policymaking. The software is made
> publicly available for reuse in an open repository.
