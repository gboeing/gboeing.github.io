I have a new [chapter](https://doi.org/10.4337/9781789903942.00039) titled
"Urban Analytics: History, Trajectory and Critique," co-authored with Mike
Batty, Shan Jiang, and Lisa Schweitzer, now published in the _Handbook of
Spatial Analysis in the Social Sciences_, edited by Serge Rey and Rachel
Franklin.

From our abstract:

> Urban analytics combines spatial analysis, statistics, computer science, and
> urban planning to understand and shape city futures. While it promises
> better policymaking insights, concerns exist around its epistemological
> scope and impacts on privacy, ethics, and social control. This chapter
> reflects on the history and trajectory of urban analytics as a scholarly and
> professional discipline. In particular, it considers the direction in which
> this field is going and whether it improves our collective and individual
> welfare. It first introduces early theories, models, and deductive methods
> from which the field originated before shifting toward induction. It then
> explores urban network analytics that enrich traditional representations of
> spatial interaction and structure. Next it discusses urban applications of
> spatiotemporal big data and machine learning. Finally, it argues that
> privacy and ethical concerns are too often ignored as ubiquitous monitoring
> and analytics can empower social repression. It concludes with a call for a
> more critical urban analytics that recognizes its epistemological limits,
> emphasizes human dignity, and learns from and supports marginalized
> communities.
