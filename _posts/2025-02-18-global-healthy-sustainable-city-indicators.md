I recently co-authored an [article][1], "Global Healthy and Sustainable City
Indicators: Collaborative Development of an Open Science Toolkit for Calculating
and Reporting on Urban Indicators Internationally," now published in
_Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science_. This was a
collaboration with my colleagues at the Global Observatory of Healthy and
Sustainable Cities, in which we discuss our spatial software co-development
process with collaborators and practitioners around the world.

From the abstract:

> Measuring and monitoring progress towards achieving healthy, equitable and
> sustainable cities is a priority for planners, policymakers and researchers in
> diverse contexts globally. Yet data collection, analysis, visualisation and
> reporting on policy and spatial indicators involve specialised knowledge,
> skills, and collaboration across disciplines. Integrated open-source tools
> for calculating and communicating urban indicators for diverse urban contexts
> are needed, which provide the multiple streams of evidence required to
> influence policy agendas and enable local changes towards healthier and more
> sustainable cities. This paper reports on the development of open-source
> software for planning, analysis and generation of data, maps and reports on
> policy and spatial indicators of urban design and transport features for
> healthy and sustainable cities. We engaged a collaborative network of
> researchers and practitioners from diverse geographic contexts through an
> online survey and workshops, to understand and progressively meet their
> requirements for policy and spatial indicators. We outline our framework for
> action research-informed open-source software development and discuss benefits
> and challenges of this approach. The resulting Global Healthy and Sustainable
> City Indicators software is designed to meet the needs of researchers,
> planners, policy makers and community advocates in diverse settings for
> planning, calculating and disseminating policy and spatial urban indicators.
