I am presenting my ongoing research into the recent evolution of American street
network planning and design at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research
Board in Washington DC on January 13. This presentation asks the question: how
has street network design changed over time, especially in recent years? I
analyze the street networks of every US census tract and estimate each's
vintage.

Street network designs grew more disconnected, coarse-grained, and circuitous
over the 20th century... but the 21st century has witnessed a promising rebound
back toward more traditional, dense, and interconnected grids. Higher
griddedness is associated with less car ownership, even when controlling for
related socioeconomic, topographical, and other urban factors.

Update: the paper has been [published in _JAPA_][1].
