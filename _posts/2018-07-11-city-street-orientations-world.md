This post is adapted from this [research paper][4] that you can read/cite for
more info. It analyzes and visualizes [100 cities][1] around the world.\_

By popular request, this is a quick follow-up to [this post][3] comparing the
orientation of streets in 25 US cities using Python and [OSMnx][2]. Here are 25
more cities around the world:

![City street network grid orientations, rose plot, polar histogram made with
Python, OSMnx, OpenStreetMap, matplotlib. Bangkok, Barcelona, Beijing, Budapest,
Cairo, Delhi, Dubai, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Lagos, London, Madrid, Melbourne,
Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Munich, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Seoul, Sydney,
Tehran, Toronto, Warsaw, Tokyo, Berlin, Venice][6]

And for reference, here's [the original][3] that looked only at American cities:

![City street network grid orientations, rose plot, polar histogram made with
Python, OSMnx, OpenStreetMap, matplotlib. Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Charlotte,
Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles,
Manhattan, New York, Miami, Minneapolis, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix,
Portland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle, St Louis, Tampa, Washington
DC.][5]

that analyzes and visualizes [100 cities][4] around the world, discussing these
methods, entropy calculations, and images in more detail. And for more on OSMnx,
