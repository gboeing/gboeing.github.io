Alongside Billie Giles-Corti and Jim Sallis, I will be presenting our team's
recent research into accessible, sustainable urban design around the world at
the ISPAH Congress in Abu Dhabi this week.
Our symposium at the congress will share the methods and findings from our
[_The Lancet Global Health_]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/2022/06/lancet-series-transport-health/)
series published this summer, as well as our ongoing work on the
[Thousand Cities Challenge](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/).

Our geospatial team developed open-source software to calculate indicators of
walkability and accessibility around the world, and then linked these back to
cities' policy contexts and identified populations living above and below
estimated thresholds for physical activity. Few cities had measurable policy
standards and targets to actually build healthier and more sustainable cities,
and their health-supportive built environment features were often inadequate
or inequitably distributed.

We simultaneously launched the [Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable
Cities](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/) to promote healthy and
sustainable urban planning, benchmark and monitor cities' progress, and share
more consistent, comparable urban data. The whole [series of
articles](https://www.thelancet.com/series/urban-design-2022) is free and open
access, as is [our software](https://github.com/global-healthy-liveable-cities).
