AAG session call for papers: "Urban spatial analytics: Toward problem-driven
methods instead of methods-driven problems."

I'm organizing a session with [Elizabeth Delmelle][2] that asks: how can urban
data science and spatial analytics meaningfully address cities' "wicked
problems" instead of just reaching for this year's shiny new tool or the easy
data set we can just grab and analyze?

Cities today face challenges that feel intractable. Despite significant progress
in urban data science and spatial analytics over the past 20 years, the problems
tackled by this scholarship too often prioritize the "low-hanging fruit"
publication pipeline of letting easily available data and trendy methods
determine the research question rather than confronting urgent but arduous
challenges. Methods-driven research that gestures toward real-world applications
frequently features policy implications wholly detached from the political
constraints and implementation realities that practitioners must navigate.

We seek papers (theoretical, empirical, or viewpoint/commentary) that challenge
and critique this status quo. This is an opportunity to experiment, try new
things, attempt something hard that may not work, present null findings and
research failures -- as long as you propose something ambitious to use spatial
methods to meaningfully improve urban living.

Submissions should use real-world problems to drive the methods (rather than
letting preferred methods determine the research problem) in urban data science
and spatial analytics. Example topics could include:

- spatial data storytelling for societal change
- data visualization to foster urban political conversations in an era of
  polarization
- evidence-based communication to persuade local stakeholders for the public
  good
- changing people's minds about a crisis with frozen battlelines, such as
  climate change
- tangibly attenuating an urban wicked problem like homelessness or
  unaffordability
- shifting negative public narratives around cities that run counter to
  empirical evidence
- communicating the value of planning, funding, and infrastructure in an era of
  budget crises and defunding
- lessening (rather than merely describing) inequity in deeply segregated and
  unequal cities
- anything else that ambitiously tries to address a big problem facing cities
  through the tools of urban data science and spatial analytics that has the
  potential to produce meaningful and plausible change

**Where/When** : this session will be in-person at the American Association of
Geographers [Annual Meeting][1], March 17-21, 2026, San Francisco, California.

**How to submit** : submit your abstract to AAG by its Oct 30 deadline. Then
email your abstract and AAG PIN to both Geoff (boeing at usc dot edu) and
Elizabeth (delmelle at design dot upenn dot edu) by Nov 1 for us to consider for
the session. Session participants will be notified by Nov 20.
