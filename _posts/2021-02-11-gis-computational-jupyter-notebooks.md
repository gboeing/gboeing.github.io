I have a new chapter "[GIS and Computational Notebooks]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/publications/gis-and-computational- notebooks/)," co-authored
with Dani Arribas-Bel, out now in _The Geographic Information Science &
Technology Body of Knowledge_. Want to make your spatial analyses more
reproducible, portable, and well-documented? Our chapter is a short, gentle
intro to using code and notebooks for modern GIS work.

Science and analytics both struggle with reproducibility, documentation, and
portability. But GIS in both research and practice _particularly_ suffers from
these problems due to some of its unique characteristics. Our chapter discusses
this challenge and its urgency for building better and more actionable knowledge
from geospatial data. Then we introduce an emerging solution, the computational
notebook, using Jupyter as our central example to illustrate what it does and
how it works.

Notebooks offer GIS researchers and practitioners better integration with modern
software, more natural access to new forms of data, and better alignment with
the principles and benefits of open science. Compared to traditional desktop
GIS, notebooks can make spatial analysis more nimble, extensible, and
reproducible. They are the "glue" that binds together a broader ecosystem of
open-source packages and transferable platforms (e.g., Docker) for modern
geographic data science.

Takeaway: do your analytics in a notebook, use open-source tools, and
containerize your environment. Once you get the hang of it, you'll never want to
go back to ye olde closed-source point-and-click GUIs of yore.

Here's the chapter abstract:

> Researchers and practitioners across many disciplines have recently adopted
> computational notebooks to develop, document, and share their scientific
> workflows – and the GIS community is no exception. This chapter introduces
> computational notebooks in the geographical context. It begins by explaining
> the computational paradigm and philosophy that underlie notebooks. Next it
> unpacks their architecture to illustrate a notebook user's typical workflow.
> Then it discusses the main benefits notebooks offer GIS researchers and
> practitioners, including better integration with modern software, more natural
> access to new forms of data, and better alignment with the principles and
> benefits of open science. In this context, it identifies notebooks as the glue
> that binds together a broader ecosystem of open source packages and
> transferable platforms for computational geography. The chapter concludes with
> a brief illustration of using notebooks for a set of basic GIS operations.
> Compared to traditional desktop GIS, notebooks can make spatial analysis more
> nimble, extensible, and reproducible and have thus evolved into an important
> component of the geospatial science toolkit.
