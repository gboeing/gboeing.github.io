I recently coauthored an [article][1] titled "A Review of the Structure of
Street Networks" with Marc Barthelemy in _Transport Findings_. On a personal
note, Marc has long been a personal hero of mine and was the 2nd most cited
author in my dissertation, after Mike Batty (who I also recently had the
pleasure of [collaborating][2] with).

![Street network orientation in Chicago (low entropy), New Orleans (medium
entropy), and Rome (high entropy) with polar histograms.][3]

From the abstract:

> We review measures of street network structure proposed in the recent
> literature, establish their relevance to practice, and identify open
> challenges facing researchers. These measures' empirical values vary
> substantially across world regions and development eras, indicating street
> networks' geometric and topological heterogeneity.
