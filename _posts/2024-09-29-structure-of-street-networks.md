I recently coauthored an [article](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.122117)
titled "A Review of the Structure of Street Networks" with Marc Barthelemy in
_Transport Findings_. On a personal note, Marc has long been a personal hero
of mine and was the 2nd most cited author in my dissertation, after Mike Batty
(who I also recently had the pleasure of
[collaborating]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/2022/12/urban-analytics-history-
trajectory-critique/) with).

[![Street network orientation in Chicago \(low entropy\), New Orleans \(medium
entropy\), and Rome \(high entropy\) with polar
histograms.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/img/findings-street-
orientations-1024x692.png)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/img/findings-

From the abstract:

> We review measures of street network structure proposed in the recent
> literature, establish their relevance to practice, and identify open
> challenges facing researchers. These measures' empirical values vary
> substantially across world regions and development eras, indicating street
> networks' geometric and topological heterogeneity.
