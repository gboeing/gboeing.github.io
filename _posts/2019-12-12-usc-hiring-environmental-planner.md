USC's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis is hiring! We're looking
for an environmental planner, broadly construed, at the Assistant/Associate
Professor level. I am on the search committee and happy to answer any questions.
Work on urban resilience, sustainability, environmental security, and climate
adaptation will be especially competitive. We hope to complement our
department's cross-cutting themes of 1) social justice and 2) data and the built
environment at the methodological cutting-edge. We are looking broadly for new
scholarly ideas and you do not have to hit on every theme to be a strong
applicant. If your research/teaching touches any of these topics, we would love
to see you apply and learn more about your work.

Please share widely!
