I recently published
[an article](https://transfersmagazine.org/magazine-article/issue-11/rethinking-the-one-way-street/)
in _Transfers Magazine_ with Billy Riggs questioning some of the received wisdom
about one-way streets and efficiency. This builds on our [recent research]({{ "/2022/07/two-way-street-network-efficiency/" | relative_url }})
published in JPER modeling vehicle distance traveled before and after
hypothetical one-way to two-way street conversions.

One-way streets offer many benefits for driving speed, signal timing, traffic
friction, etc. But, as we note in the article:

> Just as one-way streets make traffic faster, two-way streets can slow it down
> — improving safety, accommodating multimodal travel, increasing livability and
> property values, and helping customers more easily reach businesses.

But there's also an efficiency argument for two-way streets that, though
relatively small, is too often ignored:

> One-way streets also have an inherent inefficiency, which leads to longer
> driving distances: They prevent drivers from taking the most direct route to
> their destinations.

Our research found that two-way street conversions (all else equal) would allow
for significantly shorter average travel distances: San Francisco's as- is
network's average intra-city trip is about 1.7% longer than it could be if it
were all two-way streets, corresponding to 27 million kilometers of annual
surplus travel just for intra-city trips.
