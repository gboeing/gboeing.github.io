I have a new article out now in a special issue on platform urbanism, co-
authored with Max Besbris, David Wachsmuth, and Jake Wegmann, titled [Tilted
Platforms: Rental Housing Technology and the Rise of Urban Big Data
Oligopolies][1]. We reflect on short-term and long-term rental housing
technologies and how they're affecting the housing search, equity, and
affordability.

From the abstract:

> This article interprets emerging scholarship on rental housing
> platforms—particularly the most well-known and used short- and long-term
> rental housing platforms—and considers how the technological processes
> connecting both short-term and long-term rentals to the platform economy are
> transforming cities. It discusses potential policy approaches to more
> equitably distribute benefits and mitigate harms. We argue that information
> technology is not value-neutral. While rental housing platforms may empower
> data analysts and certain market participants, the same cannot be said for all
> users or society at large. First, user-generated online data frequently
> reproduce the systematic biases found in traditional sources of housing
> information. Evidence is growing that the information broadcasting potential
> of rental housing platforms may increase rather than mitigate sociospatial
> inequality. Second, technology platforms curate and shape information
> according to their creators' own financial and political interests. The
> question of which data—and people—are hidden or marginalized on these
> platforms is just as important as the question of which data are available.
> Finally, important differences in benefits and drawbacks exist between
> short-term and long-term rental housing platforms, but are underexplored in
> the literature: this article unpacks these differences and proposes policy
> recommendations.
