Happy new year! In the spring semester I'll be teaching two new courses: Big
Data for Cities and Advanced Spatial Analysis of Urban Systems. The former
serves as a sort of gateway course to Northeastern's urban informatics master's
program, introducing students to urban theories and scientific methods of
analyzing urban data. The latter introduces advanced students to a computational
workflow of spatial analysis and statistics with Python, PostGIS, and other
open-source tools. I'll be creating my lectures as Jupyter notebooks and will
share a GitHub link soon when they're all together.
