I have a new article out in Region: Journal of the European Regional Science
Association, "[Urban Street Network Analysis in a Computational Notebook][2]."
It reflects on the use of Jupyter notebooks in applied data science research,
pedagogy, and practice, and it uses the [OSMnx examples][1] repository as an
example.

From the abstract:

> Computational notebooks offer researchers, practitioners, students, and
> educators the ability to interactively conduct analytics and disseminate
> reproducible workflows that weave together code, visuals, and narratives. This
> article explores the potential of computational notebooks in urban analytics
> and planning, demonstrating their utility through a case study of OSMnx and
> its tutorials repository. OSMnx is a Python package for working with
> OpenStreetMap data and modeling, analyzing, and visualizing street networks
> anywhere in the world. Its official demos and tutorials are distributed as
> open-source Jupyter notebooks on GitHub. This article showcases this resource
> by documenting the repository and demonstrating OSMnx interactively through a
> synoptic tutorial adapted from the repository. It illustrates how to download
> urban data and model street networks for various study sites, compute network
> indicators, visualize street centrality, calculate routes, and work with other
> spatial data such as building footprints and points of interest. Computational
> notebooks help introduce methods to new users and help researchers reach
> broader audiences interested in learning from, adapting, and remixing their
> work. Due to their utility and versatility, the ongoing adoption of
> computational notebooks in urban planning, analytics, and related
> geocomputation disciplines should continue into the future.
