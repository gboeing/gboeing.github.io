My short article "[Estimating Local Daytime Population Density from Census and
Payroll Data]({{ "/publications/estimating-density-census-payroll/" | relative_url }})" is out now in the latest
issue of _Regional Studies, Regional Science_. I discuss a method for estimating
local daytime density across a metropolitan area using US Census and LEHD LODES
data, and dig into some limitations and biases. I look at the San Francisco Bay
Area as a case study:

Area]({{ "/files/img/sf-bay-daytime-population-density-map.jpg" | relative_url }})

From the abstract:

> Daytime population density reflects where people commute and spend their
> waking hours. It carries significant weight as urban planners and engineers
> site transportation infrastructure and utilities, plan for disaster recovery,
> and assess urban vitality. Various methods with various drawbacks exist to
> estimate daytime population density across a metropolitan area, such as using
> census data, travel diaries, GPS traces, or publicly available payroll data.
> This study estimates the San Francisco Bay Area's tract-level daytime
> population density from US Census and LEHD LODES data. Estimated daytime
> densities are substantially more concentrated than corresponding night-time
> population densities, reflecting regional land use patterns. We conclude with
> a discussion of biases, limitations, and implications of this methodology.
