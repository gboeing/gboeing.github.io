I have a new [article][1] out now in the journal of _Urban Policy and Research_
coauthored with a team comprising many of the folks from our recent [series][2]
in _The Lancet Global Health_. The article is titled "Policy-Relevant Spatial
Indicators of Urban Liveability and Sustainability: Scaling from Local to
Global" and discusses measuring urban indicators and scaling the software to
calculate them from a local case study to a worldwide effort.

From the abstract:

> Urban liveability is a global priority for creating healthy, sustainable
> cities. Measurement of policy-relevant spatial indicators of the built and
> natural environment supports city planning at all levels of government.
> Analysis of their spatial distribution within cities, and impacts on
> individuals and communities, is crucial to ensure planning decisions are
> effective and equitable. This paper outlines challenges and lessons from a
> 5-year collaborative research program, scaling up a software workflow for
> calculating a composite indicator of urban liveability for residential address
> points across Melbourne, to Australia's 21 largest cities, and further
> extension to 25 global cities in diverse contexts.

For more, check out the [article][1] itself. And you may also be interested in
our recent _The Lancet Global Health_ [series][2] of articles that developed
similar themes in great depth.
