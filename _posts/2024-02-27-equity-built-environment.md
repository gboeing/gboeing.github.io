I coauthored a recently published
[article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110827) in _Building and
Environment_ which systematically reviews perspectives on and approaches to
social equity in the built environment. From the abstract:

> Equity in the built environment refers to the extent to which the built
> environment meets the needs of different groups through planning, design,
> construction, operation, management, and regulation. Though much studied in
> recent years, some needs and groups have received a greater research focus
> than others, and significant inequities continue to exist. Following PRISMA
> guidelines, we systematically reviewed the distributional and recognitional
> aspects of inequities experienced by vulnerable groups regarding their needs
> while using/occupying different types of built environments. We find that more
> studies focus on inequities regarding residential buildings, transportation
> facilities, and public open spaces, whereas comparatively few studies examine
> water and energy infrastructure, commercial buildings, educational buildings,
> and healthcare facilities. More studies focus on well-being, mobility, and
> access needs than shelter and safety needs. Inequities experienced by
> minorities, people with low socioeconomic status, people with health concerns,
> and vulnerable age groups receive more attention than the inequities
> experienced by people with gender/sexual- orientation vulnerability or
> displaced groups. The literature exhibits a relatively narrow focus on some
> subgroups, such as refugees, people experiencing homelessness, people with
> cognitive differences, people with visual or hearing impairments, children,
> and women. We argue that these findings demarcate high-impact future research
> directions to address vulnerable groups' needs worldwide and suggest measures
> to alleviate inequities in the built environment.
