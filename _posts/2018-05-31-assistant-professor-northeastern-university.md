I'm happy to announce that I have accepted a tenure-track offer from
Northeastern University as an assistant professor of urban informatics in the
School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs, with a faculty affiliation in
Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/).
I will be starting in the Fall and moving to Boston later this summer!
