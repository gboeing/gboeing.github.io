Does _food_ matter in neighborhood design? Should it? The answers to these
questions are complicated and obscured by decades of perplexing policy and
practice. There are many benefits of good food – that is, food which is healthy,
affordable, fair, and sustainable. Proper nourishment has been linked in several
studies to better classroom performance. Walkable access to healthy food can
reduce America's growing obesity and diabetes epidemics. Locally- sourced food
can reinforce better dietary habits as consumers connect with the value chain
and see eating as a more natural process.

The benefits are straightforward, but do most American neighborhoods actually
support healthy food access?

## Zoned Out

The answer unfortunately is no. Too often, 20th century urban planning produced
monolithic, monoculture communities in which civilization's functions are
dramatically segregated. Square miles of suburbs are zoned strictly residential,
often with explicit restrictions against front yard agriculture and no
allowances for food shops or hubs. Downtowns are widely paved over or planted
with merely ornamental landscapes. Humans – an urban species – eat several times
a day yet seem fixated on zoning food out of the urban experience.

This is partly a result of the food system's complexity. As a matter of
perceived necessity, America urbanized over the last century according to the
principles of modernism laid out by Le Corbusier and Robert Moses: a place for
everything and everything in its place. Food production exclusively became the
domain of our rural, agricultural, "fly-over" places, while urban policy and
governance developed under the assumption that this food supply from the
hinterlands was, forever, a given.

Divorcing ourselves from millennia of collective experience, food today seems to
appear in our supermarkets merely and inevitably for our consumption. As
coarse-grained zoning and planning eradicated our food's origins from our daily
lives, we began to value food as a set of abstract commodities that emphasized
cheapness and distribution over nutrition. These values, however, are fragile
things and the networks connecting urbanites and suburbanites to their food are
[tenuous](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-11/california-drought-transforms-global-food-market.html)
and
[prone to failure](https://www.citylab.com/politics/2013/10/new-yorks-looming-food-disaster/7294/).

The loss of crop species diversity for the sake of mass-production renders
producers susceptible to exotic pests and locked into an arms race of powerful
pesticides. Rising fuel costs make long distance food shipment ever more
expensive. Food delivery is reliant on complex systems of futures prices,
overnight microloans, currency valuations, and faith in credit: systems that
nearly collapsed during the early hours of the 2008 financial crisis. Terrorism,
earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires can also easily disrupt the roads and
rails that link our cities to their precious food supplies. When the Big One
finally strikes California, would your family rather live 300 miles away from
its nearest food supply, or just down the street from a community farm with days
or even weeks of produce at hand?

## Freedom of Choice

This is a problem that affects everyone in terms of massive risk, mortality
rates, and health care costs – but should it be the concern of neighborhood
designers? The past decade has given clear voice to the many people who fear
government intervention into their communities as a loss of freedom of choice.
In this case, however, food policy and neighborhood design _require_
intervention to even begin to create choice in the first place.

Few Americans can choose to live in neighborhoods with some local food supply,
because such communities largely do not exist. Further, housing affordability
means that many lower- and middle-income families lack the choice to own
multiple cars or to live in expensive, high-amenity neighborhoods with a
farmer's market on every corner. You are quite simply out of luck if your
neighborhood is designed without access to real, healthy food or if you do not
have a car to drive several miles to the nearest supermarket. A free market is
one with diverse choices. What we have here is a market failure.

Fortunately, modern urban planning theory offers some reasonable solutions to
this problem. One that is gaining traction is the idea of developing
[complete neighborhoods](https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?a=437441&c=50730)
with a range of housing options, green spaces, amenities, schedules, and
services. It means options for a community, rather than a monoculture rooted in
the bad designs of the day. Completeness at the neighborhood level means that
schools, restaurants, recreation, and errands are within walking distance of
everyone in the neighborhood. It means people have a choice to shop for good
food at a local market, participate in an urban farm, and eat nutritious meals
regardless of where they live.

The notion of complete neighborhoods is a useful and flexible framework for good
urban planning: promoting and providing diverse, holistic, and atomic
neighborhoods to support the health and diversity of the community's population.
But reality trumps wishful thinking and farmer's markets, urban agriculture, and
good food shops will not matter if they are not supported by institutions and
the community. Cities should coordinate their planning departments with food
policy councils (like [this one in LA](https://goodfoodla.org/)) and local
community development corporations to develop holistic programs.

High efficiency food production enabled our species' rapid urbanization, and we
presently cannot wholly replace industrial agriculture and still feed our
massive urban populations. Instead, good, local food is complementary. It
reconnects us with food systems as tangible processes. It creates a diversity of
sourcing choices and supports resilient communities. Further, urban density need
not be reduced to accommodate it. Good food can be sold in neighborhoods and
produced in our underutilized or interstitial spaces, such as yards, medians,
parks, vacant lots, rooftops, and ornamental landscapes. Good food is a crucial
component of the complete neighborhoods philosophy and is desperately needed in
America.
