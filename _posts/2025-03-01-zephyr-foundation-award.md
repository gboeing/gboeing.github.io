I am happy to share that I was awarded the Zephyr Foundation's 2025
[Exceptional Technical Achievement Award][2] for my work on OSMnx. This annual
award recognizes a project that has had a positive impact on the fields or
transportation and/or land use decision-making.

This year will mark the 10th anniversary of my work on the OSMnx project. It
recently reached [version 2.0][3] with a slew of new features and enhancements.
If you haven't used it before, OSMnx is a Python package to easily download,
model, analyze, and visualize street networks and any other geospatial features
from OpenStreetMap. You can download and model walking, driving, or biking
networks with a single line of code then quickly analyze and visualize them. You
can just as easily work with urban amenities/points of interest, building
footprints, transit stops, elevation data, street orientations, speed/travel
time, and routing.

If you're interested in this tool, you can [read more about it here][1].
