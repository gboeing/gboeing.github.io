I recently teamed up with an international group of public health researchers
and spatial analysts to co-author an article, [An Introduction to Software
Tools, Data, and Services for Geospatial Analysis of Stroke Services]({{
site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/software-data-geospatial- stroke/),
that has been accepted for publication at _Frontiers in Neurology_ ([download
free PDF]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/software-data-
geospatial-stroke/)).

[![Hospital catchment basin for stroke services. Spatial analysis in python,
geopandas, osmnx.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/files/img/catchment.png)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/files/img/catchment.png)

In this article, we discuss tools, data, and methodologies for building
geospatial and network-theoretic models of hospital catchment basins to analyze
the provision of stroke services in a metropolitan area. This workflow is
demonstrated in R and Python (including [OSMnx]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/2018/03/osmnx-features-roundup/)), and features static mapping and
interactive web mapping to explore the region. For more info, check out [the
article]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
