I recently teamed up with an international group of public health researchers
and spatial analysts to co-author an article, [An Introduction to Software
Tools, Data, and Services for Geospatial Analysis of Stroke Services][3], that
has been accepted for publication at _Frontiers in Neurology_ ([download free
PDF][3]).

![Hospital catchment basin for stroke services. Spatial analysis in python,
geopandas, osmnx.][2]

In this article, we discuss tools, data, and methodologies for building
geospatial and network-theoretic models of hospital catchment basins to analyze
the provision of stroke services in a metropolitan area. This workflow is
demonstrated in R and Python (including [OSMnx][1]), and features static mapping
and interactive web mapping to explore the region. For more info, check out [the
article][3].
