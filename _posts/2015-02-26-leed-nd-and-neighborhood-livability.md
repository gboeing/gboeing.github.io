I recently co-authored a journal article titled _[LEED-ND and Livability
Revisited]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/leed-nd-livability-revisited/),
_which won the [Kaye Bock award](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/64c6h2nw).
LEED-ND is a system for evaluating neighborhood design that was developed by
CNU, USGBC, and NRDC. Many of its criteria, particularly site location and
neighborhood pattern, accordingly reflect New Urbanist and Smart Growth
principles and are inspired by traditional neighborhood design.

The prominent New Urbanist practitioners who authored [The Smart Growth
Manual](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Smart_Growth_Manual.html?id=JKwebAbN5zEC)
write (p. 6.8) that LEED-ND allows us to "objectively determine the degree to
which proposed ![LEED-ND]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/img/ShowImage-300x225.jpg) projects embody
smart growth principles... it is expected that LEED-ND will become a municipal
standard for controlling the urban design of large-scale development."

There are currently 381 LEED-ND projects listed in [the
database](https://www.usgbc.org/projects) on the USGBC web site. The United
States Department of Housing and Urban Development recently started
requiring applicants to secure LEED-ND conditional approval for neighborhood
revitalization projects to be considered for Choice Neighborhoods Planning
Grants. Workshops are being pitched to cities, offering training on how to use
LEED-ND to accelerate the development of sustainable communities.

As LEED-ND grows more ubiquitous, it becomes imperative to understand its
outcomes and impacts on communities. Some of its codifiers indicate that its
standards can in fact foster neighborhood livability. For example, in their
discussion of the benefits of certification, the city of Charlottesville,
Virginia, [states that](https://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=2499)
LEED-ND helps "create more livable communities."

Our study thus poses the question: does LEED-ND actually capture livability as
defined by residents? From [our
article]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/leed-nd-livability-revisited/):

LEED-ND is increasingly being wrapped in the language of livability when it is
presented to stakeholders. Our findings complicate the sometimes
oversimplified question of how to create sustainable and livable communities.
A neighborhood's livability may be influenced in part by its pattern and
design—but also by exogenous factors and the wider landscape of complex city
and regional systems.

This is not to suggest that LEED-ND and its goals are bad. Rather, they simply
may not be sufficient for all communities seeking to develop a good
neighborhood. As we discuss in the article, LEED-ND's prescriptive nature may
also result in communities being designed according to the letter of the law
rather than the spirit of the law. So, then, what of LEED-ND? Is it an
essential tool to fight sprawl, car-oriented public space, and single-use
zoning? Or just the latest top-down normative template to prescribe the "good"
neighborhood? I hate false dichotomies, and I'd wager it lies somewhere in
between.
