I recently coauthored an [article][1] in the journal _Cities_ titled "A Road Map
for Future Data-Driven Urban Planning and Environmental Health Research." This
arose from a symposium in Sitges, Spain which I was invited to last year by the
Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

From the abstract:

> Recent advances in data science and urban environmental health research
> utilise large-scale databases (100s–1000s of cities) to explore the complex
> interplay of urban characteristics such as city form and size, climate,
> mobility, exposure, and environmental health impacts. Cities are still
> hotspots of air pollution and noise, suffer urban heat island effects and lack
> of green space, which leads to disease and mortality burdens preventable with
> better knowledge. Better understanding through harmonising and analysing data
> in large numbers of cities is essential to identifying the most effective
> means of disease prevention and understanding context dependencies important
> for policy.
