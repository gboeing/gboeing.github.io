I have a new [article]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/publications/converting-one- way-streets/) out now in the _Journal of
Planning Education and Research_ with Billy Riggs, in which we examine how
two-way street conversions impact street network efficiency. Most of the
efficiency literature looks at the benefits of one-way streets for signalization
and vehicular throughput. We took a different approach, considering how one-way
streets inherently increase travel distances.

[![How one-way to two-way street conversions affect street network efficiency
through shortest paths, distance traveled, VKT and VMT, signal timing and
intersection flow, vehicle travel speed, travel time, fuel consumption, and
greenhouse gas emissions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl

We found that two-way street conversions (all else equal) would allow for
significantly shorter average travel distances: San Francisco's as-is network's
average intra-city trip is about 1.7% longer than it could be if it were all
two-way streets, corresponding to 27 million kilometers of annual surplus travel
just for intra-city trips. From the abstract:

As cities move away from LOS, there are network efficiency arguments to be made
for two-way street conversions. While conversions have financial and political
costs, they may help cities better prepare for sustainable future mobility by
balancing various social benefits with network efficiency. For more, check out
