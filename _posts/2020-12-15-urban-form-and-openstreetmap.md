My chapter "[Exploring Urban Form Through OpenStreetMap Data: A Visual
Introduction]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/exploring-urban-form-
openstreetmap/)" has just been published in the new book _Urban Experience and
Design: Contemporary Perspectives on Improving the Public Realm_ edited by
Justin Hollander and Ann Sussman.

From the abstract:

> This chapter introduces OpenStreetMap—a crowdsourced, worldwide mapping
> project and geospatial data repository—to illustrate its usefulness in
> quickly and easily analyzing and visualizing planning and design outcomes in
> the built environment. It demonstrates the OSMnx toolkit for automatically
> downloading, modeling and visualizing spatial data from OpenStreetMap. We
> explore patterns and configurations in street networks and buildings around
> the world computationally through visualization methods—including figure-
> ground diagrams and polar histograms—that help compress urban complexity
> into comprehensible artifacts that reflect the human experience of the built
> environment. Ubiquitous urban data and computation can open up new urban
> form analyses from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.
