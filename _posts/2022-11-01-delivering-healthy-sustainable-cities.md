I have a new [article](https://doi.org/10.3138/jccpe-2022.1.1.0008) out now in
_The Journal of City Climate Policy and Economy_, coauthored with a team that
includes several of the folks from our recent [series]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/2022/06/lancet-series-transport-health/) in _The Lancet Global
Health_. The JCCPE article, "A Pathway to Prioritizing and Delivering Healthy
and Sustainable Cities," synthesizes findings and recommended policy actions
arising from that recent TLGH series.

From the abstract:

> Creating healthy and sustainable cities should be a global priority. Some
> cities prioritize 15-minute cities as a planning approach with co-benefits for
> health, climate change mitigation, equity, and economic recovery from
> COVID-19. Yet, as our recent _The Lancet Global Health_ series on "Urban
> Design, Transport, and Health" showed, many cities have a long way to go to
> achieve this vision. This policy guideline summarizes the main findings of the
> series, which assessed health and sustainability indicators for 25 cities in
> 19 countries. We then outline steps governments can take to strengthen policy
> frameworks and deliver more healthy, equitable, and sustainable built
> environments. _The Lancet Global Health_ series provided clear evidence that
> cities need to transform urban governance to enable integrated planning for
> health and sustainability and commit to policy implementation.
> Evidence-informed indicators should be used to benchmark and monitor progress.
> Cities need policy frameworks that are comprehensive and consistent with
> evidence, with measurable policy targets to support implementation and
> accountability. The series provided evidence-informed thresholds for some key
> urban design and transport features, which can be embedded as policy targets.
> Policies and interventions must prioritize identifying and reducing inequities
> in access to health-supportive environments. Governments should also invest in
> open data and promote citizen-science programmes, to support indicator
> development and research for public benefit. We provide tools to replicate our
> indicators and an invitation to join our 1,000 Cities Challenge via the Global
> Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities.

For more, check out the
[JCCPE article](https://doi.org/10.3138/jccpe-2022.1.1.0008) itself. And you may
also be interested in our recent _The Lancet Global Health_ [series]({{
site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/2022/06/lancet-series-transport-health/) of
articles that developed similar themes in great depth.
