I recently coauthored an [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119324)
in _Environmental Research_, titled "Exploring the Nexus of Urban Form,
Transport, Environment and Health in Large-Scale Urban Studies: A
State-of-the-Art Scoping Review." This arose from a symposium in Sitges, Spain
which I was invited to last year by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

From the abstract:

> As the world becomes increasingly urbanised, there is recognition that public
> and planetary health relies upon a ubiquitous transition to sustainable
> cities. Disentanglement of the complex pathways of urban design, environmental
> exposures, and health, and the magnitude of these associations, remains a
> challenge. A state-of-the-art account of large-scale urban health studies is
> required to shape future research priorities and equity- and evidence-informed
> policies. The purpose of this review was to synthesise evidence from
> large-scale urban studies focused on the interaction between urban form,
> transport, environmental exposures, and health. This review sought to
> determine common methodologies applied, limitations, and future opportunities
> for improved research practice. Based on a literature search, 2958 articles
> were reviewed that covered three themes of: urban form; urban environmental
> health; and urban indicators. Studies were prioritised for inclusion that
> analysed at least 90 cities to ensure broad geographic representation and
> generalisability. Of the initially identified studies, following expert
> consultation and exclusion criteria, 66 were included. The complexity of the
> urban ecosystem on health was evidenced from the context dependent effects of
> urban form variables on environmental exposures and health. Compact city
> designs were generally advantageous for reducing harmful environmental
> exposure and promoting health, with some exceptions. Methodological
> heterogeneity was indicative of key urban research challenges; notable
> limitations included exposure and health data at varied spatial scales and
> resolutions, limited availability of local-level sociodemographic data, and
> the lack of consensus on robust methodologies that encompass best research
> practice. Future urban environmental health research for evidence-informed
> urban planning and policies requires a multi-faceted approach. Advances in
> geospatial and AI- driven techniques and urban indicators offer promising
> developments; however, there remains a wider call for increased data
> availability at local-levels, transparent and robust methodologies of
> large-scale urban studies, and greater exploration of urban health
> vulnerabilities and inequities.
