In 1974, Robert Caro published _The Power Broker_, a critical biography of
Robert Moses's dictatorial tenure as the "master builder" of mid-century New
York. Moses profoundly transformed New York's urban fabric and transportation
system, producing the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge,
the Westside Highway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Lincoln Center, the UN
headquarters, Shea Stadium, Jones Beach State Park and many other projects.
However, _The Power Broker_ did lasting damage to his public image and today
he remains one of the most controversial figures in city planning history.

Today, _The Power Broker_ may be the most well-known biography of any urban
planner ever. Less-known: on August 26, 1974, Moses issued a turgid 23-page
statement denouncing Caro's work as "full of mistakes, unsupported charges,
nasty baseless personalities, and random haymakers." Moses's original
typewritten statement survives today as a grainy photocopy in the New York
City Parks Department archive. To better preserve and disseminate it, I
extracted and transcribed its text using optical character recognition and
edited the result to correct errors. My transcription of Moses's statement,
alongside Caro's response to it, is [available
