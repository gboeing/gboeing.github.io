I recently coauthored an [article](https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980241258297)
in _Urban Studies_ with Julia Harten titled "Access to the Exclusive City:
Home Sharing as an Affordable Housing Strategy." We examined how shared
housing serves increasingly diverse populations as a pathway into otherwise
unaffordable housing submarkets.

From the abstract:

> Home sharing, particularly via online platforms, is becoming a mainstream
> housing strategy as social processes evolve and housing costs rise. Recent
> research has studied shared rentals as a modality for students and kin-based
> households, as one strategy among diversifying pathways to housing and as a
> social phenomenon. However, we still know little about whether it actually
> creates opportunities for home seekers in unaffordable markets. Analysing
> online rental listings in Los Angeles, we find that shared rentals are both
> more affordable and more widely available across diverse neighbourhoods than
> traditional whole-unit rentals. Shared rentals have historically been
> understudied due to their limited data trail, but they offer important
> entryways into unaffordable markets. We argue for shared housing research to
> shift its traditional focus away from students and young adults and towards
> a broader exploration of the diverse populations that may benefit from or
> depend on shared housing.
