My article, [Measuring the Complexity of Urban Form and Design][3], is now
in-press for publication at _Urban Design International_ ([download free
PDF][3]). Cities are complex systems composed of many human agents interacting
in physical urban space. This paper develops a typology of measures and
indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the
scale of urban design. It extends quantitative measures from city planning,
network science, ecosystems studies, fractal geometry, statistical physics, and
information theory to the analysis of urban form and qualitative human
experience.

Metrics at multiple scales are scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature
and have useful applications in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both
evolves and results from local design processes. In turn, they enable urban
designers to assess resilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with
an advanced toolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research
of various neighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal,
visual, spatial, scaling, and network-analytic connectivity measures of the
urban form.

Urban design has evolved through eras of classicism, organicism, austere
modernism, postmodernism, and neotraditionalism—each of which encounters the
city's physical complexity with different goals. Today, multiple synergies exist
between urban design objectives and recent knowledge emerging from the
complexity sciences as complexity theory. Prominent urban design movements such
as the new urbanism and smart growth now openly embrace complexity. But to
better foster the benefits of healthy complex adaptive systems, urban design
must move beyond metaphor and inspiration to more precisely formalize what
complexity is and how we can measure it to assess both the world as it is, and
proposals for how it could be instead.

How does this knowledge lead to different or better urban design? First, this
typology can help urban design theory and practice critically evaluate and
normatively balance complexity goals based on local culture and politics. Urban
design, as a channel of human self-organization, can produce various balances of
order and variety in its streetscapes (anywhere from sterile monotony to
bewildering overstimulation), circulation networks (from compact grids, to
sprawling loops-and-lollipops, to dense meshes of interwoven paths), land uses
(from single-use functional zoning to intermixed variety), and social character
(from segregation and disconnection to integration, contact, and exchange).

Second, to critically evaluate these possible futures beyond metaphor and
inspiration, this paper's five dimensions of complexity and their attendant
measures can ground debate and analysis. They organize and quantify
characteristics of current and proposed urban design that shape circulation,
contact, access, choice, resilience, adaptability, and equity. For example, this
provides new ways to evaluate how thoroughly linked and permeable a network is,
and how it can be resilient against floods, earthquakes, traffic collisions,
congestion, and other disruptions. It grounds design decisions in science and
theory to clarify goals and evaluate the outcomes of alternative plans. These
measures help designers evaluate how well the physical built environment might
adapt to expected—or unexpected—change. They offer a rubric for the continuing
shift of design theory and practice away from a logic of top-down artificially
constructed urban landscapes and towards a logic of organic growth, evolution,
and resilience.
