![Geoff Boeing][5]

I am an Associate Professor in the University of Southern California's
Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis, the Director of USC's
[Urban Data Lab][6], and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings
Institution.

My research has won several [awards][10], including the Nobel Sustainability
Award, the Stough-Johansson Springer Award, and the Zephyr Foundation Technical
Achievement Award. I am regularly featured in the [media][7], including
_The Economist_, _The Guardian_, _The Atlantic_, and _The Washington Post_, and
I've presented my work at the Venice Biennale of Architecture and as a keynote
speaker at several conferences.

My research explores the spatial outcomes of urban planning through network
analysis, geospatial data science, and machine learning. I have pioneered
several new techniques and algorithms for urban network science, and I developed
and maintain the [OSMnx][1] street network modeling software, which has become a
standard tool in industry and academia. I have also consulted for many planning,
policymaking, and public health organizations.

My [research][8] has been published in journals across scientific and policy
disciplines, including _The Lancet Global Health_, the _Journal of the American
Planning Association_, _Urban Studies_, _Geographical Analysis_, and _Applied
Network Science_. I serve on the editorial boards of several journals including
_Geographical Analysis_, _Cities_, _Annals of the AAG_, and previously
_Urban Studies_.

I grew up in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and received my PhD in City and
Regional Planning from the University of California, Berkeley. I have never
played a round of golf or drunk a cup of coffee in my life.
