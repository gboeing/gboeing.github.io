![Geoff Boeing][5]{: .headshot }

I am an Associate Professor in the University of Southern California's
Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis, the Director of USC's
[Urban Data Lab][6], and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings
Institution.

My research explores the spatial outcomes of urban planning through network
analysis, geospatial data science, and machine learning. It has won several
[awards][10], including the Nobel Sustainability Award, the Stough-Johansson
Springer Award, and the Zephyr Foundation's Technical Achievement Award. My
research is regularly featured in the [media][7]—including _The Economist_,
_The Guardian_, _The Atlantic_, and _The Washington Post_—and I've presented
it at the Venice Biennale of Architecture and in several keynote talks.

I have served on the editorial boards of several journals, including
_Urban Studies_, _Annals of the AAG_, and _Cities_, and I have published my
[research][8] in journals across scientific and policy disciplines, including
_The Lancet Global Health_, the _Journal of the American Planning Association_,
_Urban Studies_, _Geographical Analysis_, and _Applied Network Science_. I also
developed and maintain the [OSMnx][1] street network modeling software—which
has become a standard tool in industry and academia—and I've consulted for
many planning, policymaking, and public health organizations.

Before all that, I grew up in Rancho Cucamonga, California and received my PhD
in City and Regional Planning from the University of California, Berkeley. I
have never played a round of golf or drunk a cup of coffee in my life.
