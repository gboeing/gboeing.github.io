I am the Director of USC's Urban Data Lab.

In the lab, my students and I study the spatial outcomes of urban planning and
their repercussions for urban living. We investigate how technology, data, and
computing have explosively reshaped city planning in recent years, using methods
spanning network analysis, geospatial data science, and machine learning.

Ongoing lab projects include measuring accessibility to daily living needs in
cities around the world, exploring how urban planning creates [spatial
order][4] through street design, and investigating how technology shapes the
modern [housing search][3] to reproduce traditional inequalities and residential
segregation.

## Prospective Students

_Interested in studying or researching with me?_ I am hiring master's and PhD
students to work in the lab. Read more about my [background][5] and
[research][7] to gauge the fit.

I particularly seek students with _strong coding and data science skills_ who
can hit the ground running in the USC Urban Data Lab. However these skills are
not prerequisites. If you attend USC, I will teach you coding and spatial data
science with Python from the ground-up primarily across two courses: PPD534
(Data, Evidence, and Communication for the Public Good) and PPDE642 (Advanced
Urban Analytics).

USC's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis features a strong
faculty in urban data science, critical data studies, and transportation/housing
analytics. _We seek students from all backgrounds_. If you're an activist or
urbanist with no tech experience, we will teach you data/tech skills to
effectively apply your knowledge to serve the community. If you're a coder or
scientist interested in urbanism and planning, we will teach you how to unlock
your skills for more equitable cities.

I encourage you to apply and join us in USC's [Master of Urban Planning][1] or
[PhD][2] programs. You can also email me to discuss your fit with the department
and the Urban Data Lab. Please [contact][6] me with a succinct, specific, and
personalized summary of why you're a good fit (your research interests,
background, and relevant skills) and attach your CV.
