I am the Director of USC's Urban Data Lab.

In the lab, my students and I study the spatial outcomes of urban planning and their repercussions for urban living. We investigate how technology, data, and computing have explosively reshaped city planning in recent years, using methods spanning network analysis, geospatial data science, and machine learning.

Ongoing lab projects include measuring accessibility to daily living needs in cities around the world, exploring how urban planning creates [spatial order]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/2019/09/urban-street-network-orientation/) through street design, and investigating how technology shapes the modern [housing search]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/2019/08/online-rental-housing-representation/) to reproduce traditional inequalities and residential segregation.

## Prospective Students

_Interested in studying or researching with me?_ I am hiring master's and
PhD students to work in the lab. Read more about my [background]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/)
and [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/) to gauge the fit.

I particularly seek students with _strong coding and data
science skills_ who can hit the ground running in the USC Urban Data Lab.
However these skills are not prerequisites. If you attend USC, I will teach
you coding and spatial data science with Python from the ground-up primarily
across two courses: PPD534 (Data, Evidence, and Communication for the Public
Good) and PPDE642 (Advanced Urban Analytics).

USC's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis features a strong
faculty in urban data science, critical data studies, and
transportation/housing analytics.  _We seek students from all backgrounds_. If
you're an activist or urbanist with no tech experience, we will teach you
data/tech skills to effectively apply your knowledge to serve the community.
If you're a coder or scientist interested in urbanism and planning, we will
teach you how to unlock your skills for more equitable cities.

I encourage you to apply and join us in USC's
[Master of Urban Planning](https://priceschool.usc.edu/mup/) or
[PhD](https://priceschool.usc.edu/upd/) programs. You can also email me to
discuss your fit with the department and the Urban Data Lab.
Please [contact]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) me with a succinct, specific, and personalized summary
of why you're a good fit (your research interests, background, and relevant
skills) and attach your CV.
