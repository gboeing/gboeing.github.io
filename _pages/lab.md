I am the Director of USC's Urban Data Lab.

Read more about our [research][7] focus and ongoing projects.

## Prospective students

_Interested in studying or researching with me?_
I am hiring master's and PhD students to work in the lab. Read more about my
[background][5] and the lab's [research][7] to gauge the fit.

I particularly seek students with strong _coding_ and _data science_ skills who
can hit the ground running in the lab. However these skills are not
prerequisites. If you attend USC, I will teach you coding and spatial data
science with Python from the ground-up primarily across two courses: PPD534
(Data, Evidence, and Communication for the Public Good) and PPDE642 (Advanced
Urban Analytics).

USC's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis features a strong
faculty in urban data science, critical data studies, and transportation/housing
analytics. _We seek students from all backgrounds_. If you're an activist or
urbanist with no tech experience, we will teach you data/tech skills to
effectively apply your knowledge to serve the community. If you're a coder or
scientist interested in urbanism and planning, we will teach you how to unlock
your skills for more equitable cities.

I encourage you to apply and join us in USC's [Master of Urban Planning][1] or
[PhD][2] programs. You can also [contact][6] me to discuss your fit with the
department and lab: send me a succinct, specific, and personalized summary of
your fit (research interests, background, relevant skills) and attach your CV.
