My research explores the spatial outcomes of urban planning through network
analysis, geospatial data science, and machine learning. I am interested in how
planners shape the urban form that shapes our lives—and, in turn, how we can
plan a better urban future. My research has won several [awards]({{ "/about/" | relative_url }}).
