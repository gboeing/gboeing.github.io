My research explores the spatial outcomes of urban planning. I am interested in
how we shape the urban form that shapes our lives—and, in turn, how we can plan
a better urban future. My work has won several [awards][9].

In the [Urban Data Lab][11], my students and I use methods spanning network
analysis, geospatial data science, simulation modeling, machine learning, and
AI. Ongoing projects include measuring [accessibility][14] to daily living
needs in cities around the world, exploring how urban planning creates [spatial
order][13] through [street design][12], and investigating how technology shapes
the modern [housing search][15] to reproduce traditional inequalities and
residential segregation.
