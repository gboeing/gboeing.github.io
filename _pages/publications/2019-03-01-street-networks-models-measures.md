## Abstract

OpenStreetMap provides a valuable crowd-sourced database of raw geospatial data
for constructing models of urban street networks for scientific analysis. This
paper reports results from a research project that collected raw street network
data from OpenStreetMap using the Python-based OSMnx software for every U.S.
city and town, county, urbanized area, census tract, and Zillow- defined
neighborhood. It constructed nonplanar directed multigraphs for each and
analyzed their structural and morphological characteristics. The resulting data
repository contains over 110,000 processed, cleaned street network graphs (which
in turn comprise over 55 million nodes and over 137 million edges) at various
scales—comprehensively covering the entire U.S.—archived as reusable open-source
GraphML files, node/edge lists, and GIS shapefiles that can be immediately
loaded and analyzed in standard tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS, NetworkX,
graph-tool, igraph, or Gephi. The repository also contains measures of each
network's metric and topological characteristics common in urban design,
transportation planning, civil engineering, and network science. No other such
dataset exists. These data offer researchers and practitioners a new ability to
quickly and easily conduct graph-theoretic circulation network analysis anywhere
in the U.S. using standard, free, open-source tools.
