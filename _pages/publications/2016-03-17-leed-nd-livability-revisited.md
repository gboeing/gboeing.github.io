## Abstract

This study examines LEED-ND's criteria for Neighborhood Pattern and Design
(NPD). LEED-ND was developed as a system for rating new neighborhoods on the
sustainability of their planning. However, it has increasingly been adopted by
cities as a de facto measure of "livable" neighborhood design and used to
accelerate development processes. We hypothesize that these criteria do not
accurately capture livability as defined by residents. Our study area is
Temescal, a gentrifying neighborhood in Oakland, CA. Temescal could not
achieve LEED-ND certification due to technical disqualifications yet residents
of the neighborhood rated its livability very highly. Furthermore, residents
consistently rated and ranked NPD characteristics quite differently than did
LEED-ND, calling into question its validity as a universally codifiable rating
system. We propose that a single set of weighted, prescriptive design
guidelines may not be able to reflect the diverse values and desired amenities
of different communities.
