## Abstract

Researchers and practitioners across many disciplines have recently adopted
computational notebooks to develop, document, and share their scientific
workflows - and the GIS community is no exception. This chapter introduces
computational notebooks in the geographical context. It begins by explaining the
computational paradigm and philosophy that underlie notebooks. Next it unpacks
their architecture to illustrate a notebook user's typical workflow. Then it
discusses the main benefits notebooks offer GIS researchers and practitioners,
including better integration with modern software, more natural access to new
forms of data, and better alignment with the principles and benefits of open
science. In this context, it identifies notebooks as the glue that binds
together a broader ecosystem of open source packages and transferable platforms
for computational geography. The chapter concludes with a brief illustration of
using notebooks for a set of basic GIS operations. Compared to traditional
desktop GIS, notebooks can make spatial analysis more nimble, extensible, and
reproducible and have thus evolved into an important component of the geospatial
science toolkit.
