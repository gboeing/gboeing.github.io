## Abstract

Background: There is interest in the use of geospatial data for development of
acute stroke services given the importance of timely access to acute reperfusion
therapy. This paper aims to introduce clinicians and citizen scientists to the
possibilities offered by open source software (R and Python) for analyzing
geospatial data. It is hoped that this introduction would stimulate interest in
the field as well as generate ideas for improving stroke services. Method:
Instructions on installation of libraries for R and Python, source code, and
links to census data are provided in a notebook format to enhance experience
with running this software. This code illustrates different aspects of using
geospatial analysis: 1) creation of choropleth (thematic) map which depicts
estimate of stroke cases per post code; 2) use of map to help define service
regions for rehabilitation after stroke. Results: choropleth map showing
estimate of stroke per post codes and service boundary map for rehabilitation
after stroke. Conclusions: the examples in this article illustrate the use of a
range of components that underpin geospatial analysis. By providing an
accessible introduction to these areas, clinicians and researchers can write
code to answer clinically relevant questions on topics such as service delivery
and service demand.
