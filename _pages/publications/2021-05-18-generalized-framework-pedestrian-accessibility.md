## Abstract

Pedestrian accessibility is an important factor in urban transport and land
use policy and critical for creating healthy, sustainable cities. Developing
and evaluating indicators measuring inequalities in pedestrian accessibility
can help planners and policymakers benchmark and monitor the progress of city
planning interventions. However, measuring and assessing indicators of urban
design and transport features at high resolution worldwide to enable city
comparisons is challenging due to limited availability of official, high
quality, and comparable spatial data, as well as spatial analysis tools
offering customizable frameworks for indicator construction and analysis. To
address these challenges, this study develops an open source software
framework to construct pedestrian accessibility indicators for cities using
open and consistent data. It presents a generalized method to consistently
measure pedestrian accessibility at high resolution and spatially aggregated
scale, to allow for both within- and between-city analyses. The open source
and open data methods developed in this study can be extended to other cities
worldwide to support local planning and policymaking. The software is made
publicly available for reuse in an open repository.
