## Abstract

The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for improving the
management of requirements in systems and systems of systems. Multiple
requirements databases may be interfaced, and language processing tools may be
used to identify requirements having related content. The relevancy of
requirements may be based on the semantic distance between terms in the network,
their semantic relations, the number of related terms in the requirements, etc.
A user may be presented with a navigable cross-section of requirements data
relevant to search terms. Thus, added visibility and ease of access is provided
for systems and systems of systems.
