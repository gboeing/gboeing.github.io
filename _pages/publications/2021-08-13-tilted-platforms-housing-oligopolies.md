## Abstract

This article interprets emerging scholarship on rental housing
platforms—particularly the most well-known and used short- and long-term rental
housing platforms—and considers how the technological processes connecting both
short-term and long-term rentals to the platform economy are transforming
cities. It discusses potential policy approaches to more equitably distribute
benefits and mitigate harms. We argue that information technology is not
value-neutral. While rental housing platforms may empower data analysts and
certain market participants, the same cannot be said for all users or society at
large. First, user-generated online data frequently reproduce the systematic
biases found in traditional sources of housing information. Evidence is growing
that the information broadcasting potential of rental housing platforms may
increase rather than mitigate sociospatial inequality. Second, technology
platforms curate and shape information according to their creators' own
financial and political interests. The question of which data—and people—are
hidden or marginalized on these platforms is just as important as the question
of which data are available. Finally, important differences in benefits and
drawbacks exist between short-term and long-term rental housing platforms, but
are underexplored in the literature: this article unpacks these differences and
proposes policy recommendations.
