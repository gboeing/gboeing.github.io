## Abstract

Computational notebooks offer researchers, practitioners, students, and
educators the ability to interactively conduct analytics and disseminate
reproducible workflows that weave together code, visuals, and narratives. This
article explores the potential of computational notebooks in urban analytics
and planning, demonstrating their utility through a case study of OSMnx and
its tutorials repository. OSMnx is a Python package for working with
OpenStreetMap data and modeling, analyzing, and visualizing street networks
anywhere in the world. Its official demos and tutorials are distributed as
open-source Jupyter notebooks on GitHub. This article showcases this resource
by documenting the repository and demonstrating OSMnx interactively through a
synoptic tutorial adapted from the repository. It illustrates how to download
urban data and model street networks for various study sites, compute network
indicators, visualize street centrality, calculate routes, and work with other
spatial data such as building footprints and points of interest. Computational
notebooks help introduce methods to new users and help researchers reach
broader audiences interested in learning from, adapting, and remixing their
work. Due to their utility and versatility, the ongoing adoption of
computational notebooks in urban planning, analytics, and related
geocomputation disciplines should continue into the future.
