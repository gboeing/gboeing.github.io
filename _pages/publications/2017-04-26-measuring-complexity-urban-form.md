## Abstract

Complex systems have become a popular lens for analyzing cities and complexity
theory has many implications for urban performance and resilience. This paper
develops a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical
complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design. It extends
quantitative measures from city planning, network science, ecosystems studies,
fractal geometry, statistical physics, and information theory to the analysis of
urban form and qualitative human experience. Metrics at multiple scales are
scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature and have useful applications
in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both evolves and results from local
design processes. In turn, they enable urban designers to assess resilience,
adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced toolkit. The
typology developed here applies to empirical research of various neighborhood
types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial, scaling, and
connectivity measures of the urban form. Today, prominent urban design movements
openly embrace complexity but must move beyond inspiration and metaphor to
formalize what "complexity" is and how we can use it to assess both the world
as-is as well as proposals for how it could be instead.
