## Abstract

This paper was presented as the 8th annual Transactions in GIS plenary address
at the American Association of Geographers annual meeting in Washington, DC. The
spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software
and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial
network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools
to model and analyze nonplanar urban spatial networks have traditionally been
inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This paper reflects on this
state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes
of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this, then reviews the
literature of multidisciplinary empirical spatial network science recently
conducted using it to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open-source
software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized
component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct
better science, we need to build better tools. The paper concludes with paths
forward, emphasizing open-source software and reusable computational data
science beyond mere reproducibility and replicability.
