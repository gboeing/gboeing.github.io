## Abstract

Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical cartography and visual
communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial patterns, propose
designs, compare alternatives, and engage the public. Classic urban form
visualizations—from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan
Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets—have compressed physical urban
complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can
enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of
understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an
information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data
offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and
evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in
urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data
science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It
demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a
collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street
network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites
around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age
of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of
worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative
perspectives.
