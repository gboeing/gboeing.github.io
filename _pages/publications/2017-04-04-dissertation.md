## Abstract

Complex systems have been widely studied by social and natural scientists in
terms of their dynamics and their structure. Scholars of cities and urban
planning have incorporated complexity theories from qualitative and quantitative
perspectives. From a structural standpoint, the urban form may be characterized
by the morphological complexity of its circulation networks—particularly their
density, resilience, centrality, and connectedness. This dissertation unpacks
theories of nonlinearity and complex systems, then develops a framework for
assessing the complexity of urban form and street networks. It introduces a new
tool, OSMnx, to collect street network and other urban form data for anywhere in
the world, then analyze and visualize them. Finally, it presents a large
empirical study of 27,000 street networks, examining their metric and
topological complexity relevant to urban design, transportation research, and
the human experience of the built environment.
