## Abstract

This morphological study identifies and measures recent nationwide trends in
American street network design. Historically, orthogonal street grids provided
the interconnectivity and density that researchers identify as important factors
for reducing vehicular travel and emissions and increasing road safety and
physical activity. During the 20th century, griddedness declined in planning
practice alongside declines in urban form compactness, density, and connectivity
as urbanization sprawled around automobile dependence. But less is known about
comprehensive empirical trends across US neighborhoods, especially in recent
years. This study uses public and open data to examine tract-level street
networks across the entire US. It develops theoretical and measurement
frameworks for a quality of street networks defined here as griddedness. It
measures how griddedness, orientation order, straightness, 4-way intersections,
and intersection density declined from 1940 through the 1990s while dead-ends
and block lengths increased. However, since 2000, these trends have rebounded,
shifting back toward historical design patterns. Yet, despite this rebound, when
controlling for topography and built environment factors all decades post-1939
are associated with lower griddedness than pre-1940. Higher griddedness is
associated with less car ownership—which itself has a well-established
relationship with vehicle kilometers traveled and greenhouse gas emissions—while
controlling for density, home and household size, income, jobs proximity, street
network grain, and local topography. Interconnected grid-like street networks
offer practitioners an important tool for curbing car dependence and emissions.
Once established, street patterns determine urban spatial structure for
centuries, so proactive planning is essential.
