## Abstract

Planning scholars have identified economic, safety, and social benefits of
converting one-way streets to two-way. Less is known about how conversions could
impact vehicular distances traveled—of growing relevance in an era of fleet
automation, electrification, and ride-hailing. We simulate such a conversion in
San Francisco, California. We find that its current street network's average
intra-city trip is about 1.7% longer than it would be with all two-way streets,
corresponding to 27 million kilometers of annual surplus travel. As
transportation technologies evolve, planners must consider different facets of
network efficiency to align local policy and street design with sustainability
and other societal goals.
