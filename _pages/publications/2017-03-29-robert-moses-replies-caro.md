## Abstract

In 1974, Robert Caro published _The Power Broker_, a critical biography of
Robert Moses's dictatorial tenure as the "master builder" of mid-century New
York. Moses profoundly transformed New York's urban fabric and transportation
system, producing the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge,
the Westside Highway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Lincoln Center, the UN
headquarters, Shea Stadium, Jones Beach State Park and many other projects.
However, _The Power Broker_ did lasting damage to his public image and today
he remains one of the most controversial figures in city planning history. On
August 26, 1974, Moses issued a turgid 23-page statement denouncing Caro's
work as "full of mistakes, unsupported charges, nasty baseless personalities,
and random haymakers." Moses's original typewritten statement survives today
as a grainy photocopy in the New York City Parks Department archive. To better
preserve and disseminate it, I have extracted and transcribed its text using
optical character recognition and edited the result to correct errors. Here I
compile my transcription of Moses's statement, alongside Caro's reply to it.
