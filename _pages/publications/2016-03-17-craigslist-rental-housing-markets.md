## Abstract

Current sources of data on rental housing—such as the census or commercial
databases that focus on large apartment complexes—do not reflect recent market
activity or the full scope of the U.S. rental market. To address this gap, we
collected, cleaned, analyzed, mapped, and visualized 11 million Craigslist
rental housing listings. The data reveal fine-grained spatial and temporal
patterns within and across metropolitan housing markets in the U.S. We find some
metropolitan areas have only single-digit percentages of listings below fair
market rent. Nontraditional sources of volunteered geographic information offer
planners real-time, local-scale estimates of rent and housing characteristics
currently lacking in alternative sources, such as census data.
