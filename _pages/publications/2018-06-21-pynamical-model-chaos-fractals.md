## Abstract

Pynamical is an educational Python package for introducing the modeling,
simulation, and visualization of discrete nonlinear dynamical systems and
chaos, focusing on one-dimensional maps (such as the logistic map and the
cubic map). Pynamical facilitates defining discrete one-dimensional nonlinear
models as Python functions with just-in-time compilation for fast simulation.
It comes packaged with the logistic map, the Singer map, and the cubic map
predefined. The models may be run with a range of parameter values over a set
of time steps, and the resulting numerical output is returned as a pandas
DataFrame. Pynamical can then visualize this output in various ways, including
with bifurcation diagrams, two-dimensional phase diagrams, three-dimensional
phase diagrams, and cobweb plots. These visualizations enable simple
qualitative assessments of system behavior including phase transitions,
bifurcation points, attractors and limit cycles, basins of attraction, and
fractals.
