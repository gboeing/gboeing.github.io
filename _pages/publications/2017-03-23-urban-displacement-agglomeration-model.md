## Abstract

Urban displacement - when a household is forced to relocate due to conditions
affecting its home or surroundings - often results from rising housing costs,
particularly in wealthy, prosperous cities. However, its dynamics are complex
and often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model of
urban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New settlements
form around a spatial amenity that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on
the resource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income,
skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either the original amenity
or to the emerging human agglomeration. As this agglomeration grows and
densifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers are displaced
from the spatial amenity on which they relied. Through path dependence, high-
income residents remain clustered around this original amenity for which they
have no direct use or interest. This toy model explores these dynamics,
demonstrating a simplified mechanism of how urban displacement and
gentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and varied
preferences for different types of amenities.
