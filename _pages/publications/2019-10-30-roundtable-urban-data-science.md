## Abstract

The field of urban analytics and city science has seen significant growth and
development in the past 20 years. The rise of data science, both in industry and
academia, has put new pressures on urban research, but has also allowed for new
analytical possibilities. Because of the rapid growth and change in the field,
terminology in urban analytics can be vague and unclear. This paper, an abridged
synthesis of a panel discussion among scholars in Urban Data Science held at the
2019 American Association of Geographers Conference in Washington, D.C.,
outlines one discussion seeking a better sense of the conceptual,
terminological, social, and ethical challenges faced by researchers in this
emergent field. The panel outlines the difficulties of defining what is or is
not urban data science, finding that good urban data science must have an
expansive role in a successful discipline of "city science." It suggests that
"data science" has value as a "signaling" term in industrial or popular science
applications, but which may not necessarily be well-understood within purely
academic circles. The panel also discusses the normative value of doing urban
data science, linking successful practice back to urban life. Overall, this
panel report contributes to the wider discussion around urban analytics and city
science and about the role of data science in this domain.
