## Abstract

An "urban physics" paradigm has emerged in recent years to argue that applying
the scientific tools of physics to urban data and processes can yield
important new insights into cities. New sources of human data have enabled
this mode of inquiry into social phenomena. Urban physicists model these data
using the quantitative toolkit of statistical physics and complex networks –
preferring parsimonious models with few parameters – to identify patterns and
fundamental relationships among the components of urban systems. Barthelemy is
an important voice in this growing field, having written several seminal
papers and monographs on statistical physics and its application to cities.
His work on complex and spatial networks remains particularly noteworthy and
has been extended by urban scholars to understand, explain, and model city
form and circulation. Best of all, some of Barthelemy's urban physics corpus
presents grounded, straightforward lessons for planning practice (e.g., recent
work examining Haussmann's spatial reorganization of Paris) – a refreshing
accomplishment in a field that too often embraces grand but vague and
idealized theories of cities... [read
