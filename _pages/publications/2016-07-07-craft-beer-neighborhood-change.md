## Abstract

Cities have recognized the local impact of small craft breweries, altering
municipal codes to make it easier to establish breweries as anchor points of
economic development and revitalization. However, we do not know the extent to
which these strategies impact change at the neighborhood scale across the U.S.
In this chapter, we examine the relationship between the growth and locations of
craft breweries and the incidence of neighborhood change. We rely on a unique
data set of geocoded brewery locations that tracks openings and closings from
2004 to the present. Using measures of neighborhood change often found in the
gentrification literature, we develop statistical models of census tract
demographic and employment data to determine the extent to which brewery
locations are associated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The
strongest predictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a
neighborhood was the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence
entirely consistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification
and craft brewing, but we do find a link between an influx of lower-to-middle
income urban creatives and the introduction of a craft brewery. We advocate for
urban planners to recognize the importance of craft breweries in neighborhood
revitalization while also protecting residents from potential displacement.
