## Abstract

Complexity theory has become a popular frame for conceptualizing and analyzing
cities. The theory proposes that certain large systems are characterized by
the nonlinear, dynamic interactions of their many constituent parts. These
systems then behave in novel and unpredictable ways—ways that cannot be
divined by examining the components of the system. Complexity theory
problematizes traditional reductionist, linear methods of scientifically
analyzing and predicting cities. It also opens up a new world of scholarship
to researchers keen to formulate new kinds of sciences that take complexity
into account. These attempts usually follow Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts:
new evidence and modes of thinking undermine an established science, and a new
science emerges to replace it.
