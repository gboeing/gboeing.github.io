## Abstract

Cities worldwide exhibit a variety of street network patterns and configurations
that shape human mobility, equity, health, and livelihoods. This study models
and analyzes the street networks of every urban area in the world, using
boundaries derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. Street network data
are acquired and modeled from OpenStreetMap with the open‐source OSMnx software.
In total, this study models over 160 million OpenStreetMap street network nodes
and over 320 million edges across 8,914 urban areas in 178 countries, and
attaches elevation and grade data. This article presents the study's
reproducible computational workflow, introduces two new open data repositories
of ready‐to‐use global street network models and calculated indicators, and
discusses summary findings on street network form worldwide. It makes four
contributions. First, it reports the methodological advances of this open‐source
workflow. Second, it produces an open data repository containing street network
models for each urban area. Third, it analyzes these models to produce an open
data repository containing street network form indicators for each urban area.
No such global urban street network indicator data set has previously existed.
Fourth, it presents a summary analysis of urban street network form, reporting
the first such worldwide results in the literature.
