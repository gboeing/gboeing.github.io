## Abstract

As the rental housing market moves online, the Internet offers divergent
possible futures: either the promise of more-equal access to information for
previously marginalized homeseekers, or a reproduction of longstanding
information inequalities. Biases in online listings' representativeness could
impact different communities' access to housing search information, reinforcing
traditional information segregation patterns through a digital divide. They
could also circumscribe housing practitioners' and researchers' ability to draw
broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and
affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across
the US and finds that they spatially concentrate and over- represent whiter,
wealthier, and better-educated communities. Other significant demographic
differences exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and
household size. Most cities' online housing markets are digitally segregated by
race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility,
community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher utilization, and automated
monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While Craigslist contains
valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and available
rental supply in real-time, it does not evenly represent all market segments.
The Internet promises information democratization, and online listings can
reduce housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology
access/preferences and information channel segregation can concentrate such
information-broadcasting benefits in already-advantaged communities, reproducing
traditional inequalities and reinforcing residential sorting and segregation
dynamics. Technology platforms like Craigslist construct new institutions with
the power to shape spatial economies, human interactions, and planners' ability
to monitor and respond to urban challenges.
