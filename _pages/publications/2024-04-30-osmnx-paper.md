## Abstract

OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing
urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A
large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies
across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering,
computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and
implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods.
The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously
documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern
capabilities, usage, and design, in addition to the scientific theory and logic
underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development
and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.
