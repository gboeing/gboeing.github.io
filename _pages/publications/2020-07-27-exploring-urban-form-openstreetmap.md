## Abstract

This chapter introduces OpenStreetMap—a crowdsourced, worldwide mapping project
and geospatial data repository—to illustrate its usefulness in quickly and
easily analyzing and visualizing planning and design outcomes in the built
environment. It demonstrates the OSMnx toolkit for automatically downloading,
modeling and visualizing spatial data from OpenStreetMap. We explore patterns
and configurations in street networks and buildings around the world
computationally through visualization methods—including figure-ground diagrams
and polar histograms—that help compress urban complexity into comprehensible
artifacts that reflect the human experience of the built environment. Ubiquitous
urban data and computation can open up new urban form analyses from both
quantitative and qualitative perspectives.
