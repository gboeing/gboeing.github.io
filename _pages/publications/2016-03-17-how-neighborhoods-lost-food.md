Does food matter in neighborhood planning and design? Should it matter? The
answer is yes, but decades of planning policy and practice seem to suggest
otherwise. There are many proven benefits of healthy, accessible, affordable
and sustainable food. Proper nourishment has been linked to better classroom
performance. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention argue that
walkable access to healthy food can reduce America's growing obesity and
diabetes epidemics. Locally-sourced food reinforces better dietary habits as
consumers connect with the value chain and perceive eating as a more natural
process.
