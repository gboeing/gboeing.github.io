## Abstract

Housing scholars stress the importance of the information environment in shaping
housing search behavior and outcomes. Rental listings have increasingly moved
online over the past two decades and, in turn, online platforms like Craigslist
are now central to the search process. Do these technology platforms serve as
information equalizers or do they reflect traditional information inequalities
that correlate with neighborhood sociodemographics? We synthesize and extend
analyses of millions of US Craigslist rental listings and find they supply
significantly different volumes, quality, and types of information in different
communities. Technology platforms have the potential to broaden, diversify, and
equalize housing search information, but they rely on landlord behavior and, in
turn, likely will not reach this potential without a significant redesign or
policy intervention. Smart city advocates hoping to build better cities through
technology must critically interrogate technology platforms and big data for
systematic biases.
